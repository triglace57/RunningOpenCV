# RunningOpenCV

The goal of this projet is to analyse my body during a running.

Currently the projet consider :
- 1 - Stride length (distance between ankles)
- 2 - Right knee angle (hip, knee, ankle)
- 3 - Left knee angle (hip, knee, ankle)
- 4 - Torso angle (right shoulder, left shoulder, hip)
- 5 - Right foot strike (angle between right ankle and the ground)
- 6 - Left foot strike (angle between left ankle and the ground)
- 7 - Shoulder symmetry (height difference between right and left shoulders)

At the moment, interpretation is performed by a third party.
